#BEAP Intro

##Modular terminology for control signals
- CV: control voltage. Continuous control. 
- Gate: high signal step signal. Can indicate the duration of a note, how long a key is pressed.
- Trigger: A spike of signal.
- Pitch CV: 1v/oct. For ex 0V = C1, 1V = C2, ...
But all signals are of the same nature as audio signal, and you can experiment interchanging roles.

Ranges from -5V to +5V.

##
- VCA: Voltage controlled amplifier or attenuator.
